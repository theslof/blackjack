# Blackjack game skeleton
A skeleton for a simple Blackjack game, meant as a way to practice JavaScript development.

## Instructions
>To get the most out of this project you need [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

To begin you will need to clone (aka. download a copy of) this project to your computer using git, or by downloading the project zip file by clicking on the `Code` button to the top right of this GitHub page.
When you want to edit the code I suggest that you use a good editor or IDE, such as VSCode (which is free) or WebStorm (which is not).
Simply open the project using your editor and all the source code that you need to edit can be found in the `src` directory.

### View project without using node
Open the `index.html` file found in the `src` directory.

### NPM commands
If you have Node.js installed you can run the following commands:

#### Start project
```
npm run serve
```
A minimalistic web server will start and serve the project on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

#### Start project in watch mode
```
npm run watch
```
Just like the previous command, a web server will start. Any changes made to files in the `src` directory will automatically reload the page.

#### Run the tests
```
npm run test
```
Verify that your code is working as expected by using the included tests.

## Solution
If you want to check my solution for each function (there are many ways to solve each problem), or just run the game to see it in action, check out the branch named `solution`.

IMPORTANT! If you have made changes to the code you need to either commit them first, or you will run into issues:
```
git commit -a -m "My work in progress"
```

```
git checkout solution
```
To return to your work in progress you need to check out the `master` branch:
```
git checkout master
```
