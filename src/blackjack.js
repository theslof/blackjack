/*
  Welcome!

  Please fill in the functions you find in here to build the blackjack game. This is intended both as an exercise in
  programming as well as game development, so many of the functions are designed to use earlier functions. Due to this
  it is recommended that you start from the top and work your way down.

  If you would like the unicode characters for playing card, have a look here:
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_cards_in_Unicode
  Using these you could expand upon this project to include visuals using the full cards, without relying on images.


  The rules for Blackjack are fairly simple:
    * The goal is to get a higher valued Hand than the Dealer without going Bust
    * Each player draws one card at a time until they get Blackjack (21), decide to Stand or they go Bust
    * You go Bust when the total value of your hand is more than 21
    * Numbered cards are worth the same as their number
    * Face cards -- Jack(11), Queen(12), King(13) -- are worth 10
    * Ace(1) is worth 1 or 11 depending on what is more beneficial
    * There is only one player and no Dealer for this implementation, but feel free to expand on the project

  A Card is represented by a JavaScript object with two properties, suit and value.
  The Seven of Clubs, or 7â™£:
  {
    suit: 'CLUBS',
    value: 7,
  }

  A Deck is an array of Cards, and a new deck will contain one copy of all 52 cards.
  A Hand is also an array of Cards, but representing the cards a player is currently holding.

   These are used by many editors to give code hints and auto-completions. If your editor supports it they can be very
   helpful. You will see these before each function containing what parameters the function expects, as well as a short
